# Arda User Experience

This Storybook site is the living documentation and prototype gallery for **@arda-cards/ui-components** &#8212; the shared React component library for the Arda platform.

It serves three audiences:

- **Designers** review visual fidelity, interaction patterns, and full-page application mocks.
- **Developers** discover reusable components, read API documentation, and run interaction tests.
- **Product owners** walk through end-to-end use cases and validate acceptance criteria.

### Components

The component library, organized by **Atomic Design** level and **maturity stage**:

**Stable** (`@arda-cards/ui-components`) &#8212; Promoted, production-ready components. Currently contains placeholders while existing components are being reorganized.

**Canary** (`@arda-cards/ui-components/canary`) &#8212; Experimental components not yet promoted to stable. The canary&#8594;stable dependency direction is enforced by ESLint boundary rules.

**Extras** (`@arda-cards/ui-components/extras`) &#8212; Supplementary components that extend the core library. All previously stable components (atoms, molecules, organisms) currently live here.

Within each stage, components are organized by atomic level:

- **Atoms** &#8212; Smallest building blocks: buttons, badges, inputs, confirm dialogs, cell editors.
- **Molecules** &#8212; Compositions of atoms: cards, tables, data grids.
- **Organisms** &#8212; Complex compositions: sidebars, drawers, data grids, entity viewers.

Each component includes:

- A **documentation page** (MDX) describing purpose, configuration lifecycle, usage, and accessibility.
- **Stories** demonstrating visual variants, runtime states, and interactive behavior.
- **Auto-generated props tables** from TypeScript interfaces.

### Visual Elements

Design tokens and foundational styles extracted from the Figma source of truth:

- **Colors** &#8212; The Arda color palette (primary orange, link blue, neutrals).
- **Icons** &#8212; Icon inventory from Lucide.
- **Assets** &#8212; Logos and brand assets.

### Applications

Full-page application mocks that simulate how components appear in a real product context. Each mock comes in three variants:

- **Production** &#8212; Mirrors the real application layout and behavior.
- **Development** &#8212; Adds debug overlays and feature banners.
- **Design** &#8212; Adds dotted structural borders for design review sessions.

Application mocks compose library components into realistic pages (e.g., items data grid with tab navigation, search, and pagination). See the **Applications** docs page for how to create new mocks and promote local components to the shared library.

### Dev Witness

Vendored production page components from the `arda-frontend-app` repository, rendered against MSW mock services. Unlike the hand-built application mocks above, these are the actual production page components kept in sync via an automated CI pipeline. Each page story carries route traceability metadata and is covered by interaction tests and visual regression baselines. See the **Dev Witness Integration** docs page for architecture details and the **Dev Witness Contributing** page for how to add new stories.

### Canary Refactor

An active working area that mirrors the Dev Witness pages but progressively replaces vendored production components with canary-stage library components. Each page here validates that canary components can serve as drop-in replacements for their production counterparts, enabling side-by-side comparison with the Dev Witness originals for visual and functional parity.

### Use Cases

End-to-end user workflow scenarios that validate how the application supports real tasks. Each use case provides:

- A **Description** (MDX) &#8212; the product-level specification with user story, acceptance criteria, and sample data.
- An **Interactive** story &#8212; hands-on exploration with live form inputs.
- A **Stepwise** story &#8212; guided demo that advances scene-by-scene for walkthroughs.
- An **Automated** story &#8212; regression test driven by a play function.

Current use case areas include Inventory (add item) and Reference (items, business affiliates).

## Component Architecture

All components follow the **interface separation pattern** documented in the Component Guidelines page. In brief:

- **StaticConfig** &#8212; properties chosen at design time that never change (labels, variants, structure).
- **RuntimeConfig** &#8212; properties driven by application state that change during the component lifetime (loading, selection, event handlers).
- **InitConfig** &#8212; optional mount-time properties for one-time setup (async data fetching).

Component names use the `Arda` prefix (e.g., `ArdaButton`, `ArdaDataGrid`, `ArdaItemsDataGrid`). Files use kebab-case. Directories are organized by atomic level.
