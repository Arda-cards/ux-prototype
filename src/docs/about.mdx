# Arda User Experience

This Storybook site is the living documentation and prototype gallery for **@arda-cards/ui-components** &#8212; the shared React component library for the Arda platform.

It serves three audiences:

- **Designers** review visual fidelity, interaction patterns, and full-page application mocks.
- **Developers** discover reusable components, read API documentation, and run interaction tests.
- **Product owners** walk through end-to-end use cases and validate acceptance criteria.

## How the Sidebar Is Organized

The sidebar groups content into five top-level sections. Each section has a distinct purpose and audience.

### Docs

### Components

The component library, organized by **Atomic Design** level:

- **Atoms** &#8212; Smallest building blocks: buttons, badges, inputs, confirm dialogs, cell editors (select, typeahead).
- **Molecules** &#8212; Compositions of atoms: cards, tables, data grids (with column persistence and items presets).
- **Organisms** &#8212; Complex compositions: sidebars, item drawers, items data grid.

Each component includes:

- A **documentation page** (MDX) describing purpose, configuration lifecycle, usage, and accessibility.
- **Stories** demonstrating visual variants, runtime states, and interactive behavior.
- **Auto-generated props tables** from TypeScript interfaces.

### Visual Elements

Design tokens and foundational styles extracted from the Figma source of truth:

- **Colors** &#8212; The Arda color palette (primary orange, link blue, neutrals).
- **Icons** &#8212; Icon inventory from Lucide.
- **Assets** &#8212; Logos and brand assets.

### Applications

Full-page application mocks that simulate how components appear in a real product context. Each mock comes in three variants:

- **Production** &#8212; Mirrors the real application layout and behavior.
- **Development** &#8212; Adds debug overlays and feature banners.
- **Design** &#8212; Adds dotted structural borders for design review sessions.

Application mocks compose library components into realistic pages (e.g., items data grid with tab navigation, search, and pagination). See the **Applications** docs page for how to create new mocks and promote local components to the shared library.

### Use Cases

End-to-end user workflow scenarios that validate how the application supports real tasks. Each use case provides:

- A **Description** (MDX) &#8212; the product-level specification with user story, acceptance criteria, and sample data.
- An **Interactive** story &#8212; hands-on exploration with live form inputs.
- A **Stepwise** story &#8212; guided demo that advances scene-by-scene for walkthroughs.
- An **Automated** story &#8212; regression test driven by a play function.

Current use case areas include Inventory (add item) and Reference (items, business affiliates).

## Component Architecture

All components follow the **interface separation pattern** documented in the Component Guidelines page. In brief:

- **StaticConfig** &#8212; properties chosen at design time that never change (labels, variants, structure).
- **RuntimeConfig** &#8212; properties driven by application state that change during the component lifetime (loading, selection, event handlers).
- **InitConfig** &#8212; optional mount-time properties for one-time setup (async data fetching).

Component names use the `Arda` prefix (e.g., `ArdaButton`, `ArdaDataGrid`, `ArdaItemsDataGrid`). Files use kebab-case. Directories are organized by atomic level.
