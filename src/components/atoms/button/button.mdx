# ArdaButton

A themed button with four visual variants and three sizes. Supports a loading state that displays a spinner and disables interaction.

## Configuration Lifecycle

### Static Configuration (Design Time)

Properties chosen when the button is placed in a layout. These define the button's visual identity and do not change at runtime:

- **variant** — `primary` (filled orange), `secondary` (white with border), `ghost` (transparent), or `destructive` (red). Determines the color scheme and hover behavior.
- **size** — `sm` (2rem height), `md` (2.5rem, default), or `lg` (3rem). Affects height, padding, and font size.

### Runtime Configuration (Dynamic)

Properties driven by application state that may change during the component's lifetime:

- **loading** — When `true`, shows a CSS spinner animation and disables the button. Use during async operations (save, submit, fetch).
- **disabled** — Standard HTML disabled attribute (inherited from `ButtonHTMLAttributes`). Reduces opacity and prevents interaction.

## Usage

### Primary Action

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Loading State

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

### All Variants

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.AllVariants} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={ButtonStories} />

## Accessibility

- Renders as a native `<button>` element, inheriting keyboard focus and screen reader semantics.
- The loading spinner is a CSS pseudo-element — add `aria-busy="true"` on the parent form or region during async operations for screen reader context.
- When `disabled` or `loading`, the button is removed from the tab order via the native `disabled` attribute.

- **ArdaSidebar** — Uses buttons for the logout action.
