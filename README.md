## Quick Start

```bash
make install   # Install dependencies

Run `make help` to see all available targets.

## Creating a New Prototype

1. **Copy the sample folder:**
   ```bash
   cp -r src/app/prototypes/sample src/app/prototypes/my-feature
   ```

2. **Edit `src/app/prototypes/my-feature/page.tsx`** with your wireframe components.

3. **Register it in the gallery** by adding an entry to the `prototypes` array in `src/app/page.tsx`.

4. Run `make dev` and browse to `http://localhost:3000/prototypes/my-feature`.
